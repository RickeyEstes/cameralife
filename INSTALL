 A. Pre-requesites

   Camera Life requires: PHP with MySQL support and GD with JPEG support.
   The server needs to support Content Negotiation (see the .htaccess file).

 B. Auto install

   Untar the package and point your browser to the created folder.

 C. The hard way - if auto install fails

   If using tablename prefixes: edit setup/install.mysql and add the 
   prefix to each table in each INSERT and CREATE statement

   Using linux:

     $ su
     # mysqladmin create cameralife
     # mysql cameralife
     mysql> grant all privileges on cameralife.* to USER identified by 'PASS';
     mysql> quit
     # mysql cameralife < setup/install.mysql

   Using cPanel X - click MySQL Databases

     Add Db: cameralife
     Add User: USER PASS
     Add user to Db with all privs

     Click phpMyAdmin
     Choose the database on the left
     Click SQL on the top
     Browse for setup/install.mysql

   Now edit modules/config.inc with the credentials you chose.

   Point your web broswer to the site and register an account.

   Run the SQL command: UPDATE users SET auth=5;
     * prefix users with your tablename prefix if necessary
