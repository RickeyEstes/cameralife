* UPGRADING Camera Life from any version
*

Upgrading from an older version of Camera Life requires working knowledge of MySQL.
Basically, it goes like this:

  * Look at your database structure
  * Look at the new database structure (in setup/install.mysql)
  * Update your tables to the new format.
  * Paste this into modules/config.inc, making changes as necessary:

    <?php
    $db_host = 'localhost';
    $db_name = 'cameralife';
    $db_user = 'cameralife';
    $db_pass = '5b887nj';
    $db_prefix = '';
    ?>

  * Paste the new source files on top of the old ones

  * Now enter the site:
  * Register an account named "admin"
  * UPDATE users SET auth=5 WHERE username='admin'
  * Point your browser to install/index3.php

Extra notes:

  In some recent versions, there was a unique key on photos.filename, but we
  finally got rid of that.

  In some older versions admin/.htaccess was used for security, that is no
  longer necessary. But you will want the new .htaccess in your root directory.

  Image sizes can now be null (lazy thumbnailing):)
  alter table photos change height height int(11);
  alter table photos change tn_height tn_height int(11);
  alter table photos change width width int(11);
  alter table photos change tn_width tn_width int(11);

  insert into preferences VALUES('core','cache_dir','images/cache','images/cache');
  mkdir images/cache
  chmod 777 images/cache
