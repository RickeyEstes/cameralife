* UPGRADING Camera Life from any version to any version
*

Upgrading from an older version of Camera Life requires working knowledge of MySQL.
Basically, it goes like this:

  * Look at your database structure
  * Look at the new database structure (in setup/install.mysql)
  * Update your tables to the new format
  * Edit modules/config.inc, using modules/config-example.inc as a template
  * Paste the new source files on top of the old ones

  * Now enter the site:
  * Register an account named "admin"
  * UPDATE users SET auth=5 WHERE username='admin'
  * Point your browser to install/index3.php

Extra notes:

  * Pay attention to unique keys, the key on photos.filename was removed in 2.5
  * admin/.htaccess was removed in 2.2
  * .htaccess was added in 2.5

  Image sizes can now be null (lazy thumbnailing):)
  alter table photos change height height int(11);
  alter table photos change tn_height tn_height int(11);
  alter table photos change width width int(11);
  alter table photos change tn_width tn_width int(11);

  mkdir images/cache
  chmod 777 images/cache
