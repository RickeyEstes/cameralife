* UPGRADING Camera Life from any version to any version
*

Upgrading from 2.6.3 to newer versions with SVN:
  * Back up your database and photos
  * Run `svn up`
  * Load your site and follow upgrade instructions

Upgrading from 2.6.3 to newer versions with stable releases:
  * Back up your database and photos
  * Rename the folder of your existing site
  * Unzip the new Camera Life to your server
  * Move your previous modules/config.inc and photos into the new folder
  * Load your site and follow upgrade instructions

Upgrading from versions earlier than 2.6.3 requires working knowledge of MySQL:
  * Back up your database and photos
  * Make coffee
  * Try instructions above for Upgrading from 2.6.3 to newer versions with stable
  * When the automatic updater fails, mail cameralife-bugs @ phor.net
  * Continue on your own with the following:

  * Compare your database structure to the new structure (in setup/install.mysql)
  * Update your tables to the new format
  * Edit modules/config.inc, using modules/config-example.inc as a template
  * Paste the new source files on top of the old ones

  * Now enter the site:
  * register an account named "admin"
  * UPDATE users SET auth=5 WHERE username='admin'
  * Point your browser to install/index3.php
  * Update your modules/config.inc and add $db_schema_version = 1;

Extra notes upgrading from versions before 2.5 (year 2005 and earlier):

  * Pay attention to unique keys, the key on photos.filename was removed in 2.5
  * admin/.htaccess was removed in 2.2
  * .htaccess was added in 2.5
