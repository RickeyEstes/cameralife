# How to make themes - Camera Life 2.3.2+
#

To create your own theme, simply copy any existing theme to a 
new folder. Select this theme from your admin interface on the site.

Change the CSS PHP and images to create your own unique look. The only
restriction is that you must not change the function parameters of the
PHP functions. And your functions must work for all documented combinations
of parameters (e.x. passing NULL or "").

When complete, visit http://fdcl.sourceforge.net "themes" page and submit.
