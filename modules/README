Camera Life Module API


Camera life has FEATURES, and each feature is a folder in the modules/folder. Functionality in a FEATURE is implemented by a MODULE. 

When a page loads, it requests FEATURES like this:
$features=array('theme','fileStore', 'imageProcessing', 'security');
require "main.inc";

Preferences for which MODULE implements a given FEATURE are configured in the administration section and stored in the PREFERENCES for the CameraLife class. You can view the default selections in main.inc.


To find all modules that implement a given FEATURE, do for example:

$allThemes = $cameralife->GetModules('themes');
