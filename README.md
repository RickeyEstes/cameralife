Features
--------
1. Great photo organization

   Photos are sorted in folders and also by albums/topics with automatic 
categorization by keywords.
   
2. Full audit trail

   If you have open access and someone adds lame comments or photo 
descriptions, you can easily revert changes to the site.
   
3. Easy to install and try

   See the installation flyover at http://youtu.be/aWDdMfyPwwo  (1 minute 
5 second video)

4. Easy to get photos in

  Users can upload photos via the web, FTP access, iPhoto, iPhone, 
Mac/Windows/Linux software, Digikam, or any other product that supports 
FTP.

5. Responsive

  Supports OpenSearch, OpenGraph and RSS. Is built using JQuery/AJAX for modernbrowsers, 
but gracefully degrades without Javascript for accessibility... or if you want 
to load it on a cell phone made in the 90's.
  
6. Integrates well with your site

  Code is documented and integrates with your database and security model. 
Photos store on your server, Amazon S3, a remote FTP/SFTP server, and rsync.net. 
It scales if you want to offload thumbnailing to separate server(s).
