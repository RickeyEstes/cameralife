== Now stuff / Fun stuff ==
mv setup -> modules

* rss for comments
* Interface instead of classes where appropriate, (requires PHP5)
* Move Update Database functionality into Path.class.inc
* grep upgrade hack

-- Showstoppers (before you release) --
* grep -r TODO .
! edit setup/install.mysql
* database changes into setup
* Increment version in main.inc


-- Change theme engine --
! Make admin/*.php not use the Theme API
  - a nice css file
* Separate all form and content
? Combine GetIcon and GetSmallIcon?
? Use XML to represent passing of HTML?
* Don't use $_GET except at the top of each user-facing page


-- Things that will break the API --
* Change photos.mtime to photos.filter
  - This will use a modification string like in picasa.ini
* Add a photo modification optimization engine to photo.class.php
  - It takes the existing photo and filter
  - Considers the new filter
  - Deletes stale caches
  - Acts in the best possible way
    . Rotate existing photo
    . Or start from scratch
    . Chooses to work off original or scaled image
  - Result: editing a photo will not require modifying the full sized image (takes forever) unless the user loads that full size image, in which case it is cached.
  - Admin may update these cache at their whim via the Update Database in Files in Admin
* Save all photo caches in a caches folder, not scaled, modified, ...
  - remove preferences, only keep photo_cache_dir
  - in photo.class.php, suffix each asset: 23496_480.jpg, 28762_150.jpg photoid_scalesize.jpg
* use posix-compliant pathname and a way to upgrade you db
 - benefits?

? logs.value_old is techically unnecessary
* Enumerate the photos.status

-- The big picture --
! Integrate with CMS's like Phpnuke!?

-- Features --
* Admin->* "Changes Saved" should produce a message like Gmail
* Admin->User createuser, changepasswd

-- Design Considerations --
? A module API that allows announcing modules, loading, unloading

-- UI (themes) --
* theme -> more obvious tabs
? Make Theme->AssetURL work if content negotiation is off

-- Modules --
* Make a legacy-GD module
    imagecreatetruecolor -> imagecreate
