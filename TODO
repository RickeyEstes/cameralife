==================================
BLOCKERS for the 2.6.3 release
----------------------------------

! FIX THEME FOR MSIE!
! look at bugs on sf.net ADD LINK IN THIS FILE

Any bugs left?

Also, I had a bit of a
struggle getting photos to upload.  Seems that the /images/photos/upload/
directory did't get created during the install process and the mkdir
function couldn't create the /images/photos/upload/admin directory that it
wanted to use.  I finally tracked it all down and created the directories
manually and everything is good.  Not sure if that's a bug or not.  Looks
like great software.  Thanks in advance for your help.


===================
RELEASE HOWTO
-------------------

! Regression testing / validation:
  Regression: microformats, sitemaps, rss, gallery API, OpenSearch, hacks
  update module API's and documentation
  photostore does not fully protect private photos
  harden against malicio us user inputs and sql inj ection -- you like that anti-grep obfuscation?
  and uploading non-images
  #vim setup/install.mysql

===========================
TODO AFTER THE NEXT RELEASE
note: bleeding edge ideas are at: http://camera.phor.net/TODO
----------------------------

!=need to do, *=todo, ?=waste of time

? change photostore to be a true FileStore, no knowledge of what's a thumbnail
! create help pages at http://fdcl.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page and link to them from inside CL
  -- which pages?
! switch to smarty
  -- use rentacoder or a themes contest
* Should throm 404s from topic and folder.php
! http://blathersource.org/blog/
! Make more secure 
  ! find . -follow \( -name ".svn" \) -prune -o -print | xargs grep -Hn //TODO
  ! grep GET  -r modules/theme/*/*inc
  ! grep PHP_SELF  -r modules/theme/*/*inc
  ! grep Database -r modules/theme/*/*inc
  ! grep '\./' */*php | grep -v requ
! harden against XSRF: 
  ! fix transactions: each fdcl install get a random number (secret). This i hashed with the user's senssion cookie and put on all forms.
  ! when receiving the form, validate the hash.
! move Image stuff further out into ImageProcessing
* generalize photo metadata: exif, comments, ratings, flickr backup/restore hack
? an option to use SSL for private photos
? Email upload photos, like flickr # http://www.phpclasses.org/browse/file/3.html
! Theme bounty! iPod Nano / shuffle?
! folders is very slow...
* hacks/rename.php - allow it to work on all files in a given path
* picasa compatibility - for photo modification string
* OpenID providers: (yahoo, blogger, AIM, LiveJournal, myspace)
* VALID HTML STRICT!!!
* fdcl.sf.net analytics
? PHP E_ALL strict?

-- The big picture --
! Integrate with CMS's like Phpnuke!?
! Fantastico
? Gallery theme compatibility
! i18n

-- Things that will break the API --
* Change photos.mtime to photos.filter
- This will use a modification string like in picasa.ini
* Add a photo modification optimization engine to photo.class.php
- It takes the existing photo and filter
- Considers the new filter
- Deletes stale caches
- Acts in the best possible way
. Rotate existing photo
. Or start from scratch
. Chooses to work off original or scaled image
- Result: editing a photo will not require modifying the full sized image (takes forever) unless the user loads that full size image, in which case it is cached.
- Admin may update these cache at their whim via the Update Database in Files in Admin
? logs.value_old is techically unnecessary
* Enumerate the photos.status and other columns
* A standard way of getting information about modules, and loading them (compare to theme-info.php)

-- Features --
* Admin->* "Changes Saved" should produce a message like Gmail as in Photo.php

-- UI (themes) --
* theme -> more obvious tabs
? Make Theme->AssetURL work if content negotiation is off
