== TODO before a release ==
* grep -r TODO .
! edit setup/install.mysql
* database changes into setup
* Increment version in main.inc
! Update themes
Setup checks for content negotiation and modrewrite (fetch index?test=true and ...

Google opensocial/friendconnect

note, bleeding edge ideas are at: http://camera.phor.net/TODO

-- VALID HTML STRICT!!!

* never link to anything with .php, always use SmallIcon to get a link
  - then we can easily switch to use modrewrite by putting an if() in the
  - GetSmallIcon

* handle relative paths when using rewrite for paths: http://camera.phor.net/folders/2008/2008-03%20Eurotrip/ -> css -> thumbnails

-- Now stuff / Fun stuff --
* grep upgrade hack

-- Change theme engine --
* Don't use $_GET except at the top of each user-facing page
  - passing variables to the theme engine
* Separate all form and content
? Combine GetIcon and GetSmallIcon?


-- Things that will break the API --
* Change photos.mtime to photos.filter
  - This will use a modification string like in picasa.ini
* Add a photo modification optimization engine to photo.class.php
  - It takes the existing photo and filter
  - Considers the new filter
  - Deletes stale caches
  - Acts in the best possible way
    . Rotate existing photo
    . Or start from scratch
    . Chooses to work off original or scaled image
  - Result: editing a photo will not require modifying the full sized image (takes forever) unless the user loads that full size image, in which case it is cached.
  - Admin may update these cache at their whim via the Update Database in Files in Admin
? logs.value_old is techically unnecessary
* Enumerate the photos.status and other columns

-- The big picture --
! Integrate with CMS's like Phpnuke!?
! Fantastico

-- Features --
* Admin->* "Changes Saved" should produce a message like Gmail as in Photo.php
* A logs module that gives you a receipt for any change you make
  - you can undo any arbitrary receipt


-- Design Considerations --
? A module API that allows announcing modules, loading, unloading

-- UI (themes) --
* theme -> more obvious tabs
? Make Theme->AssetURL work if content negotiation is off
