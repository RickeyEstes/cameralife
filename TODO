==================================
TODO For the 2.6.2 Realease Cycle
----------------------------------

Any bugs left?


 Also, I had a bit of a
struggle getting photos to upload.  Seems that the /images/photos/upload/
directory did't get created during the install process and the mkdir
function couldn't create the /images/photos/upload/admin directory that it
wanted to use.  I finally tracked it all down and created the directories
manually and everything is good.  Not sure if that's a bug or not.  Looks
like great software.  Thanks in advance for your help.

find . -follow \( -name ".svn" \) -prune -o -print | xargs grep -Hn //TODO
! grep GET  -r modules/theme/*/*inc

move Image stuff further out into ImageProcessing

generalize photo metadata: exif, comments, ratings, flickr backup/restore hack
don't handle hits in the theme(), do it before the showpage();

an option to use SSL for private photos

Email upload photos, like flickr # http://www.phpclasses.org/browse/file/3.html

Theme bounty! iPod Nano / shuffle?


#vim setup/install.mysql

folders is very slow...

edit rename hack - allow it to work on all files in a given path

Validate
Regression: microformats, sitemaps, rss, gallery API, OpenSearch, hacks
update module API's and documentation
photostore does not fully protect private photos
harden against malicio us user inputs and sql inj ection -- you like that anti-grep obfuscation?
  and uploading non-images

picasa compatibility

grep '\./' */*php | grep -v requ

Upload to flickr - set tags, asbums, directory...

!=need to do, *=todo, ?=waste of time

! OpenID providers: (yahoo, blogger, AIM, LiveJournal, myspace)
* Google friendconnect
* VALID HTML STRICT!!!
* fdcl.sf.net analytics

-- The big picture --
! Integrate with CMS's like Phpnuke!?
! Fantastico
? Gallery theme compatibility

-- Things that will break the API --
* Change photos.mtime to photos.filter
  - This will use a modification string like in picasa.ini
* Add a photo modification optimization engine to photo.class.php
  - It takes the existing photo and filter
  - Considers the new filter
  - Deletes stale caches
  - Acts in the best possible way
    . Rotate existing photo
    . Or start from scratch
    . Chooses to work off original or scaled image
  - Result: editing a photo will not require modifying the full sized image (takes forever) unless the user loads that full size image, in which case it is cached.
  - Admin may update these cache at their whim via the Update Database in Files in Admin
? logs.value_old is techically unnecessary
* Enumerate the photos.status and other columns
* A standard way of getting information about modules, and loading them (compare to theme-info.php)

-- Features --
* Admin->* "Changes Saved" should produce a message like Gmail as in Photo.php

-- UI (themes) --
* theme -> more obvious tabs
? Make Theme->AssetURL work if content negotiation is off
