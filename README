I INTRODUCTION

  Camera Life is a system for cataloging your photo collection. It gives 
  users the ability to search or browse your archive in intuitive ways, with
  an attention to powerful administrative functions.


II FEATURES

 A Self Updating

   Camera Life will automatically cache and thumbnail photos it finds in your
   system. Photos are automatically assorted into Albums based on their
   descriptions.

 B Photo Albums

   Users can browse your photos by file system hierarchy (files in folders),
   or by Albums. An Album is a collection of photos containing a certain word
   in their description. Since the system knows which photos are related, it 
   can suggest photos that a user may be interested in while they are browsing.

 C Security

   Users sign up for accounts from the main page. An Admin can then grant 
   privileges to users (Administer:User Manager:Users). You can also integrate
   Camera Life into your own authentication system by creating a module.

 D Non-destructive

   Changes to your site are all logged and undoable. You can allow anyone to
   contribute photo descriptions, and then easily rollback changes in the 
   event of defacement. (Administer::Log Viewer)

 E Extensible

   You can easily add themes or iconset to your site, or integrate with your
   existing CMS or template system.

 F Web 2.0

   Camera Life supports microformats and rss and some of the interface is
   done with AJAX. It supports photocasting through an RSS feed.
