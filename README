I INTRODUCTION

  Camera Life is a system for cataloging your photo collection. It gives 
  users the ability to search or browse your archive in intuitive ways, with
  an attention to powerful administrative functions.


II FEATURES

 A Storing photos

   You can store photos in a folder on your webserver, another FTP/WWWserver,
   Amazon S3 or Flickr. Photos added to your "photostore" will be recognized
   by Camera Life and cached/thumbnailed.

 B Organizing Photos

   Photos are browsable by file heirarchy. You can edit the description for
   each photo and add tags. Then you can create Albums, which are groups of
   photos containing some search term. As you rename and tag photos, they
   are automatically added to or removed from Albums. Each Album is a member
   of a Topic.

   Camera Life will learn how photos are related and present the user with
   photos that are related to the one currently showing.

 C The social effect

   You can allow site users to edit photo description, add tags, comment
   on photos and flag photos for deletion. This is enabled by default. All
   actions on the site have an audit trail and can be undone. This is under
   the Administer interface.

 D Extensible

   The code is very modular. You can easily add themes or iconset to your 
   site, or integrate with your existing CMS or template system.

 E Web 2.0 / Integration

   Camera Life supports microformats and some of the interface is done with 
   AJAX. It supports photocasting through an RSS feed. iPhone users will
   see a special version of the site. Camera Life is compatible with the
   Gallery Remote API, so you can use tools designed for Gallery to upload
   your photos to the site:

     iPhoto:      http://zwily.com/iphoto/
     KDE/digikam: http://www.digikam.org/?q=about/features09x
