I INTRODUCTION

  Camera Life is a system for cataloging your photo collection. It gives 
  users the ability to search or browse your archive in intuitive ways, with
  an attention to powerful administrative functions.


II FEATURES

 A Self Updating

   Camera Life will cache and thumbnail photos it finds in your photo 
   directory automatically. Photos are automatically assorted into Albums based 
   on their descriptions. You can allow anyone to update your site without 
   fear of defacement.

 B Photo Albums

   In addition to viewing photos by file system hierarchy (files in folders), 
   users may browse your site by Albums. An Album is a collection of like 
   photos. Since the system knows which photos are related, it can suggest 
   photos that a user may be interested in while they are browsing.

 C Security

   Users sign up for accounts from the main page. An Admin can then grant 
   privileges to users (Administer:User Manager:Users). You can also integrate
   Camera Life into your own authentication system by creating a module.

 D Non-destructive

   Changes that users can make to your site are all logged and undoable. If 
   you would like to use an open access policy where anyone can contribute 
   photo descriptions, you can easily rollback changes in the event of 
   defacement. (Administer::Log Viewer)

 E Extensible

   You can easily add themes or iconset to your site, or integrate with your
   existing CMS or template system.

 F Web 2.0

   Camera Life supports microformats and rss and some of the interface is
   done with AJAX.
