<h1>How do Logs and Checkpoints work?</h1>

This page explains how Logs and Checkpoints work. Administering your site is earier with these features.

<h2>Logs</h2>

When anyone makes a change to the site, that action is logged. For example, if
someone changes the desciption of a photo to "THIS IS A TEST", you can undo
that by using the Logs administration page.

<h2>Checkpoints</h2>

A checkpoint indicates that everything looks OK. When you make a checkpoint,
logs of changes before the checkpoint are hidden, since you said that they were
OK.

<h2>Using checkpoints</h2>

If you use checkpoints, you will only see changes that you haven't seen before,
saving you time.
