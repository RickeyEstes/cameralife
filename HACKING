Project goals:
 - Release often
 - Integrate with Content Management Systems
 - Integrate with other great services

Feedback, hints and a couple patches are always coming, which is great. Code is highly modular, and patches are always coming from people integrating into their own site.

* What happens when the user loads a page?
* A typical page load...
*

 - The user loads http://camera.phor.net/photos/5392

 - Apache translates this using Rewrite into http://camera.phor.net/photo.php?id=5392

 - photo.php runs and instantiates main.inc which loads a CameraLife object and sets everything up

 - photo.php uses $_GET['id'] to instantiate a Photo object. The photo class is defined in modules/core/photo.class.inc

 - The photo class looks up information about the photo by retreiving from the database

 - The database functionality is delegated as a feature through CameraLife, and it is currently implemented by the MysqlDatabase class which lives in modules/database/mysql/mysql.inc

 - photo.php delegates displaying the page through a Theme module (ShowPage function)

 - The theme is responsible for displaying stuff to the user

 - Any post requests or ajax calls are sent to photo_controller.php
