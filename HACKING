* Here is information for people looking to contribute.
* First of all, don't read this documentation until you've installed and used the software.

Project goals:
 - Release often
 - Document code
 - Add themes
 - Integrate with CMS's

Cool stuff:
 - We'd like to integrate with Picasa and Digikam
 - Better photo modification

Feedback, hints and a couple patches are always coming, which is great. Now that the code is highly modular, we are hoping for some more crazy patch writes.

For more details, check the TODO file.

* What happens when the user loads a page?
* A typical page load...
*

- The user load http://camera.phor.net/photos/5392

- Apache translates this according to: RewriteRule ^(.*)photos/(\d+) $1photo.php?id=$2&%{QUERY_STRING}

- photo.php runs and instantiates main.inc which loads a CameraLife object and sets everything up

- photo.php uses $_GET['id'] to instantiate a Photo object. The photo class is defined in modules/core/photo.class.inc

- The photo class looks up information about the photo by retreiving from the database

- The database functionality is delegated as a feature through CameraLife, and it is currently implemented by the MysqlDatabase class which lives in modules/database/mysql/mysql.inc

- The currently loaded theme gets called a ShowPage function with 'photo' and the instantiated photo object

- The theme is responsible for displaying stuff to the user

- Any post requests or ajax calls are sent to photo_controller.php
