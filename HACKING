Project goals:
 - Release often
 - Document code
 - Polish the install process

Strategic goals:
 - Support new databases and image libraries
 - Integrate with CMS's

Cool stuff:
 - We'd like to integrate with Picasa and Digikam
 - Better photo modification

Feedback, hints and a couple patches are always coming, which is great. In the future we are expecting to pick up some developers and crazy patch writes once this code gets easier to work with.

These goals should provide the inspiration to take this project forward into 2008 and provide a better solution for managing photo collections online.

Documentation:

First of all, don't read this documentation until you've installed and used the software.

Let's start from the UI down into the details...

- The user loads photo.php (or album, or stats, or ...)

- This page includes main.inc which instantiates a CameraLife object, this is where all the features come from

- photo.php also instantiates a Photo object with an id passed from GET. The photo class is defined in modules/core/photo.class.inc

- The photo class looks up information about the photo by retreiving from the database

- The database functionality is delegated as a feature through CameraLife, and it is currently implemented by the MysqlDatabase class which lives in modules/database/mysql/mysql.inc

= If you do any POST request, they generally go through a photo_controller.php or other controller, in an effort to separate form and function
