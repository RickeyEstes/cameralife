Project Goals
=============

1.  Release often

2.  Integrate with Content Management Systems

3.  Integrate with other great services

Feedback, hints and a couple patches are always coming, which is great. Code is highly modular, and patches are always coming from people integrating into their own site.

How does this code work?
========================

This project follows the Model-View-Controller philosophy as well as PSR-1, -2, and -4 interoperability conventions. A typical page view is described below and separates concerns into Models, Views, and Controllers.

1.  A user loads <http://camera.phor.net/cameralife/photo/20739>

2.  ModRewrite in `.htaccess` translates to <http://camera.phor.net/cameralife/index.php?page=photo&id=20739>

3.  `index.php` loads the site configuration `config.php` and calls `Controller::handleRequest()`

4.  The `Controller` base class instantiates and delegates the request to `PhotoController` based on the URL

5.  `PhotoController` accessess the `Photo` model and other models to collect needed information

6.  `PhotoController` instantiates and calls `render()` on `PhotoView`, passing in the models

7.  `PhotoView` reads data from the models to write HTML to the browser

Complete API documentation is at <http://camera.phor.net/docs/>
